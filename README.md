<b>SPA's</b>

Modern web applications are increasingly built as Single-Page-Applications (SPAs) which feature a distinct frontend and backend.


<b>RESTful APIs</b>

An API (Application Programming Interface) provides an interface for developers to interact with an applicationâ€™s database. Instead of just giving someone full access to a database, 
an API sets up rules, permissions, and endpoints for various functionality: login, logout, reading a list of blogs, individual blog details, and so on.
